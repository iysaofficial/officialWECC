                      For the first time, Indonesian Young Scientists Association (IYSA) in collaboration with the Indonesia International Institute for Life Sciences (i3L) will hold an international competition specifically in the economic field namely World Economics Challenge and Competition (WECC). WECC exists to encourage the young generation to think critically and creatively in facing economic problems that arise now and in the future.
